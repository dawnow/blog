The breath of the morning

I keep forgetting

The smell of the warm summer air

I live in a town

where you can't smell a thing'

you watch your feet

for cracks in the pavement

Up above,aliens hover

making home movies

for the folks back home'

of all these weird creatures

who lock up their spirits'

drill holes in themselves

and live for their secrets

They're all uptight' uptight'

uptight' uptight',uptight' uptight

I wish that they'd sweep down in a country lane'

late at night when I'm driving

Take me on board their beautiful ship'

show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me

They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely

I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life

They'd shut me away

But I'd be alright' alright'

I'd be alright'ï¼ŒI'm alright

I'm just uptight' uptight'

uptight' uptight'

uptight' uptight'

uptight' uptight'

uptight
